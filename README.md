# Gear Planning Simplified

[xivgear.app](https://xivgear.app)

The goal of this project is to provide a better UX for assembling and testing gear sets.

The rough road map is:
- Done: Provide a good UI for making gear sets.
- Done: Allow for multiple sims on the same job to compare across multiple party comps or fights.
- Done for most jobs: Allow DPS to be simulated within the same UI, allowing changes to be quickly tested.
- Future: full or at least partial brute force BiS solving.

If you'd like to add jobs, simulations, or other features/fixes see [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).
